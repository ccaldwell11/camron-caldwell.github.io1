/**
* DATA TYPES:
* 0. Data Types are the values that can be manipulated, changed, or stored in a programming language and usually help minimize the complexity and legnth of code
* 1. Number is a value that holds onto numerical literals (i dont know if this is a good way to put this without saying "a number is a value that stores numbers")
* 2. String is a value that holds text and characters. Even if a number or symbol is included, it is interpreted by the code as a string and doesn't view the contents as manipulations or errors
* 3. Boolean is a value that results to true or false
* 4. Array is a data type that collects data in a mapped format that references data using index addresses.
* 5. Object is a data type that collects and stores data in a more complex way. Objects store data within properties of key/value pairs. 
* 6. Function is a repeatable block of code that is created to more efficienly program and run code.
* 7. undefined is when a value isn't assigned to a variable
* 8. null is value that is purposely assigned to a variable
* 9. NaN literally means "not a number"
* 10. Infinity and -Infinity (Google them if you don't know!) The way to represent infinity going in the positive and negative directions respectfully.
* 11. Simple data types are immutable and usually don't utilize as much processing power from the computer than complex data types. Complex data types are mutable and can be a lot more demanding.
* 12. When data is passed by copy, that simply means that a copy is being created. This ensures that the variable is no destroyed or altered. Passed by reference means that the function references the data at the source which also means that the data type can be altered.
